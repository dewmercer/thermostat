# Prototype Thermostat Controller

## Goal
The goal of this project is to build a simple thermostat to replace the one I have in my RV.

I want exactly two things from this theromistat which I can't find anywhere else:

1. The ability, without any internet connectivity, to control it using BLE so I dont have to get out of bed to turn it on.
2. Programable overshoot and undershoot values for the setpoint so I can better manage the duty sycle of the furnace. 

## Notes
Development board is [Seeed Studio XIAO-ESP32-C3](https://www.seeedstudio.com/Seeed-XIAO-ESP32C3-p-5431.html)

Built using ESP-IDF v4.4 and VSCode Espressive extension v1.4.0
